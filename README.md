This is a Free Code Camp project that is specifically for the frontend. An alteration was made from Javascript to TypeScript, as it is more reflective of the latest technology, while still, complementary to Javascript.  Additionally, HTML, CSS, and other FrontEnd Technologies are used in order to enhance the project.
